SQL Fiddle
==========

##About

See [the SQL Fiddle about page](http://sqlfiddle.com/about.html) page for background on the site.

## Getting the project up and running

Fork the code on github to a local branch for youself.  

You are going to need [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed locally to get SQL Fiddle running. Once you have both of these installed, and this project cloned locally, run this command from the root of your working copy:

    vagrant up

This will take a while to download the base image and all of the many dependencies. Once it has finished, you will have the software running in a set of VMs. You can now access your local server at [localhost:8080/sqlfiddle](http://localhost:8080/sqlfiddle).

You should now have a functional copy of SQL Fiddle running locally.

I'm happy to entertain pull requests!

Thanks,
